      <h1>Welcome to Quantified Savagery</h1>

<p>I'm <a href="http://cv.savageevan.com/">Evan Savage</a> and I'd like to welcome you<br>
to Quantified Savagery. I recently left my job at Facebook to focus on<br>
exploring the<br>
<a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a>,<br>
and I'm super-excited to share those explorations here on my new blog.</p>
<p>In this first post, I'll explain the Quantified Self, give you a sense of<br>
what I'll be posting in the near future, and provide some helpful tips on<br>
reading this blog.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="what-is-the-quantified-self%3F">What is the Quantified Self? <a class="direct-link" href="#what-is-the-quantified-self%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>I've had to explain this countless times to friends, family, and<br>
co-workers: why did I leave<br>
<a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Facebook-Reviews-E40772.htm">one of the world's best employers</a><br>
to explore a field most people haven't even heard of?<br>
I usually start by name-dropping<br>
<a href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a> or <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/">Nike+</a> as<br>
prominent examples of personal data collection and analysis. I then do some<br>
semi-coherent hand-waving about the vast potential of data collection and<br>
analysis. All of this is really just an attempt to cover up the fact<br>
that <em>I don't really know</em>.</p>
<p>That doesn't really cut it as an explanation for a major life decision,<br>
though, so let's look a bit deeper.</p>
<p>The Quantified Self<br>
<a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">community website</a> has this tagline:</p>
<blockquote>
self knowledge through numbers
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>self:</strong> you seek to answer <em>your</em> questions.</li>
<li><strong>knowledge:</strong> in doing this, you gain an <em>awareness</em> of your behaviors and<br>
motivations.</li>
<li><strong>through numbers:</strong> this process is driven by <em>data</em> gathered from sensors,<br>
journals, and any other tools at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good first-level approximation: you <em>gather</em> your data, <em>analyze</em> it,<br>
and <em>interpret</em> the analysis to become more <em>self-aware</em>.</p>
<p>But why is this suddenly important? After all, journal-keeping has been around<br>
roughly as long as written languages. The answer lies in <em>technology</em>. For the first time in history, over half the world's population owns<br>
sensor-packed networked computing devices. We refer to these<br>
devices as mobile phones only by historical accident. In fact, they're really<br>
powerful tools for speeding up this process of gaining<br>
<em>self knowledge through numbers</em>.</p>
<p>As I said before, though, this is only a first-level approximation. There are<br>
two main ways in which Quantified Self can achieve greater awesomeness:<br>
<em>Quantified Mass</em> and <em>Qualified Self</em>.</p>
<h3 id="quantified-mass">Quantified Mass <a class="direct-link" href="#quantified-mass">#</a></h3>
<p>As Gary Wolf pointed out in his<br>
<a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/people/gary-wolf/">interview with On the Media</a>,<br>
self-tracking doesn't lead to self-obsession but rather to group-awareness.<br>
In asking our own questions, we find that these questions are important to<br>
others as well. When many people gather comparable datasets to answer the<br>
same questions, there's an opportunity to extract insights<br>
that could benefit us all.</p>
<p>Scalable <em>mass</em> insights have massive power. Taking a 1% chunk out of the<br>
American obesity epidemic might not sound impressive, but that's potentially<br>
a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2012/08/16/what-the-obesity-epidemic-costs-us-infographic/">$6 billion impact</a><br>
on direct and indirect costs. And that's just in the United States, which<br>
counts for a tiny slice of the global mobile userbase.</p>
<p>Many of the requisite data mining tools already<br>
exist, but they're being employed to increase advertising click-through rates<br>
by 1%. The engineers building these tools aren't indifferent to societal<br>
problems; rather, <em>the datasets to solve those problems largely don't exist yet.</em><br>
Once they do, the quantified mass can start driving these massive-scale<br>
incremental wins.</p>
<h3 id="qualified-self">Qualified Self <a class="direct-link" href="#qualified-self">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
Not everything that counts can be counted,
and not everything that can be counted counts.
</blockquote>
<p>Our perception of life is rarely numerical. Much more often, it is visual,<br>
auditory, tactile, or experiential.<br>
The problem with data is that you can't<br>
<a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/KillMath">see</a> or<br>
<a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2009/02/08/haptic-compass/">feel</a> them.<br>
Even the best data scientists use<br>
data only as a means of<br>
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">telling a story</a>.</p>
<p>Put another way, this awareness process starts with qualitative questions<br>
and ends with qualitative answers. Data is the intermediate representation,<br>
one we use for its unique ability to permit detailed analysis. Ultimately,<br>
though, we're going to ask questions like</p>
<blockquote>
How can I improve my fitness?
</blockquote>
<p>and expect answers like</p>
<blockquote>
By finding training partners. By doing more engaging athletic
activities. By setting aside regularly scheduled time.
</blockquote>
<p>We're going to need moral support. We're going to give and receive advice.<br>
We're going to have conversations and <em>tell stories</em> about our personal<br>
struggles with fitness.</p>
<p>These qualified aspects of self-awareness are arguably the most important<br>
to us. <em>Data provide a stepping-stone</em>, something we can build upon<br>
to address these aspects. By building systems designed for the qualified self,<br>
we can bring the benefits of the quantified self to everyone.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-quantified-self">Back to the Quantified Self <a class="direct-link" href="#back-to-the-quantified-self">#</a></h3>
<p>That sums up why I'm so excited about Quantified Self: there really is an<br>
enormous potential here to revolutionize our lives on both the global/societal<br>
and individual levels.<br>
It's also a fantastically diverse field, one that connects hackers and<br>
doctors and entrepreneurs and teachers and artists through mutual pursuit of<br>
insanely lofty goals.</p>
<h2 id="upcoming-content">Upcoming Content <a class="direct-link" href="#upcoming-content">#</a></h2>
<p>The next few posts will detail my experiences <em>dealing with panic<br>
disorder through self-tracking</em>. I gave a talk about this to the Bay Area<br>
Quantified Self community, which you can<br>
<a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2012/07/evan-savage-on-panic-tracking/">view here</a><br>
for some initial context.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-read-this-blog">How To Read This Blog <a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-read-this-blog">#</a></h2>
<p>Although this is a blog about personal data, one of my primary goals is to<br>
make the thoughts and insights shared here accessible to a broad audience.<br>
You can filter what you read with these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/categories/non-technical/" class="category">Non-Technical</a>:<br>
expect to see insights, thoughts, discussions, descriptions<br>
of planned experiments, and post-mortems. I might link to articles, studies,<br>
or books that provide context, but I'll try to summarize the relevant<br>
parts.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/categories/technical/" class="category">Technical</a>:<br>
expect to see code, statistical analysis, $ \LaTeX $ formulae,<br>
links to <a href="https://github.com/candu">Github</a> repos, and algorithm<br>
descriptions. I'll assume familiarity with programming and mathematics, or<br>
at least a willingness to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, many of my posts will be connected to one or more experiments.<br>
For instance, my upcoming posts on self-tracking to address panic disorder will<br>
fall under the <a href="/blog/categories/panic/" class="category">Panic</a> category.<br>
For every experiment, I'll attempt to post<br>
content in both the<br>
<a href="/blog/categories/non-technical/" class="category">Non-Technical</a> and<br>
<a href="/blog/categories/technical/" class="category">Technical</a> categories.</p>
<p>Of course, I'll be glad to answer any questions you have, technical or<br>
otherwise!</p>
