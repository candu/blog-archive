      <h1>Panic!</h1>

<p>In this post, I'll tell the story of how I got started with self-tracking<br>
and talk briefly about my first experiment.</p>

<p>My success in confronting panic began with a <em>simple yet powerful insight</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
I don't know how to deal with this, but someone else might.
</blockquote>
<p>Once I had this insight, <em>seeing a psychologist</em> was the natural next step.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a <em>domain expert</em>, the psychologist knows where to find relevant<br>
information for a wide variety of conditions. I can ask her for further<br>
resources and receive <em>highly targeted recommendations</em>.</li>
<li>As a <em>stranger</em>, the psychologist provides an <em>impartial and<br>
non-judgmental sounding board</em>. I can discuss my thoughts, fears, and<br>
experiences with her and feel safe doing so.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side note, the former point reflects some of the promise of the<br>
<em>Quantified Mass</em>. When you have a specific problem,<br>
there is a subtle but crucial difference between</p>
<blockquote>
What did others try?
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
What should I try next?
</blockquote>
<p>While answering the first question is helpful, I'd argue that answering the<br>
second is an order of magnitude more helpful.</p>
<h3 id="basic-research">Basic Research <a class="direct-link" href="#basic-research">#</a></h3>
<p>My psychologist recommended the<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1572248912">Anxiety and Phobia Workbook</a>.<br>
As a survey of known symptoms, studies, treatments, and experiences, it gave me<br>
a <em>much broader set of external inputs</em> to draw on. After reading the workbook<br>
cover to cover, the natural next step was now to <em>combine these inputs into<br>
something actionable</em>.</p>
<p>I identified specific treatments that seemed easy to implement. In retrospect,<br>
my initial list was pretty large:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abdominal Breathing</strong>: by learning to <em>breathe from the abdomen</em>, you train<br>
your body to avoid the sort of shallow chest breathing that can worsen an<br>
attack.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Relaxation</strong>: through <em>meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or<br>
other prolonged exercises</em>, you remove sources of physical tension in the body.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Exercise</strong>: with <em>30 minutes of exercise per day</em>, you reduce overall<br>
stress and increase fitness.</li>
<li><strong>Positive Self-Talk</strong>: by <em>replacing internal<br>
monologues</em> like &quot;oh no, I'm having a heart attack&quot; with more positive ones<br>
like &quot;I've dealt with this before, I'm in control&quot;, you stop this<br>
mental feedback loop from making your attack worse.</li>
<li><strong>Desensitization</strong>: by <em>gradually exposing yourself to panic triggers in a<br>
safe environment</em>, you sever the mental links that tie those triggers to<br>
panic.</li>
<li><strong>Assertiveness</strong>: by <em>expressing yourself in a constructive and<br>
assertive manner</em>, you gain a sense of control over your environment<br>
that is also useful in thwarting an attack.</li>
<li><strong>Diet Modification</strong>: by <em>eliminating or reducing consumption of caffeine,<br>
simple sugars, and alcohol</em>, you reduce baseline stress.</li>
<li><strong>Supplements</strong>: by <em>taking B-complex and C vitamins</em>, your body gets the<br>
raw materials necessary to regulate stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these take <em>at most 30 minutes per day</em>, and many are <em>passive habits</em><br>
that rely on <em>small behavior modifications</em>.<br>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/268817716510713/">Small changes in habit</a><br>
are often more effective than large changes, as they are <em>easier to maintain</em>.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-experiment">My First Experiment <a class="direct-link" href="#my-first-experiment">#</a></h2>
<p>Building this list led me to another question:</p>
<blockquote>
How will I know if my condition is improving?
</blockquote>
<p>This is where <em>self-tracking</em> comes in. To answer this question, I needed<br>
to know what I was doing and whether it was working. I decided that I would<br>
keep a <em>recovery journal</em>, which I divided into four sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weekly Practice Record</strong>: this was an overview of my activity. Every day,<br>
I would check off each treatment I successfully followed. I also had areas<br>
for weekly goals and notes.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Record of Exercise</strong>: every day, I would fill in either the duration<br>
and type of exercise or a reason for not exercising.</li>
<li><strong>Food Diary</strong>: every day, I would fill in my caffeine, sugar, and alcohol<br>
consumption. I would also fill whether I took B-complex and C vitamins.</li>
<li><strong>Panic Triggers and Responses</strong>: if I experienced a panic attack, I would<br>
note the date and time, the severity, what triggered it, what specific<br>
symptoms I experienced, and how I dealt with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can view and print the log sheets<br>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B4lRh7NaNiTMNDE2ODE3ZTMtNWVjZC00M2VlLTg1NWUtZjdmZTlkMGI2NTZm/edit">on Google Docs</a>.</p>
<p>Keeping these logs took no more than five minutes per day. Tracking mechanisms<br>
are most effective when they have <em>low overhead</em>, as this lowers the willpower<br>
barrier to using them regularly.</p>

<blockquote>
How can we design systems when we don't know what we're doing?
</blockquote>
<p>Although I cribbed the individual sections almost verbatim from the workbook,<br>
their specific combination has some curious results.</p>
<p>The <em>broad</em> view of Section 1 is complemented by the <em>deep</em> view of Sections<br>
2-3. In the data visualization world, having<br>
<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">multiple levels of abstraction</a><br>
helps the viewer grasp the whole picture without losing their hold on specifics.<br>
By looking at the broad view, I knew my overall progress; by looking at the<br>
deep views, I could see the areas I needed to focus on.</p>
<p>Section 4 provides the <em>feedback loop</em>. Without this section,<br>
I can't answer my earlier question:</p>
<blockquote>
How will I know if my condition is improving?
</blockquote>
<p>My self-tracking was very <em>goal-directed</em>: I had a specific problem that I<br>
wanted to solve. There is another kind of self-tracking, one that I<br>
think many people ignore, and that is <em>exploratory</em> self-tracking.</p>
<p>Imagine this same journal without Section 4. None of the treatments are<br>
specific to panic, so they could reasonably be followed by anyone. Without the<br>
goal of confronting panic, there is <em>greater room for curiosity</em>. You could add<br>
more experiments, play with correlations, ask weirder questions like<br>
&quot;what happens if I eat a lot of <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/butter/">butter</a>?&quot;<br>
<em>Without imposing goals, there is no failure or success</em>, and that can be both<br>
a curse and a blessing. The curse is that you might not measurably improve<br>
yourself. The blessing is that you might not care!</p>
<p>I believe that, much like a<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a><br>
system, the Quantified Self community <em>needs both modes of self-tracking to<br>
thrive</em>.</p>
