      <h1>Healthy Isn&#39;t A Place You Go To</h1>

<p>In this post, I expand on some <a href="/blog/2012/10/02/welcome-to-quantified-savagery/">earlier thoughts</a> about the<br>
nature and purpose of the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self movement</a>.<br>
In looking at personal identity from a Quantified Self perspective, I argue<br>
that self-tracking gives us a means for reclaiming control of that identity.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h2 id="the-revelation">The Revelation <a class="direct-link" href="#the-revelation">#</a></h2>
<p>When I started down the philosophical path that ultimately led into the<br>
Quantified Self vortex, it was with a simple question:</p>
<blockquote>
How do we build game-like systems to improve our lives?
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't a new question. The <a href="http://realityisbroken.org/">Reality Is Broken</a><br>
thesis has long since reached tech geek mantra-hood.<br>
<a href="https://www.superbetter.com/">SuperBetter</a> and similar games have broken ground on the<br>
concrete implications of that mantra.</p>
<p>Much more recently, during a walk home with <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~valkyrie/">Valkyrie Savage</a>, I had<br>
another thought:</p>
<blockquote>
Self-tracking makes self-expertise possible.
</blockquote>
<p>We may self-track for a variety of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>addressing symptoms:</strong> perhaps I feel overweight, underslept, or stressed<br>
out.</li>
<li><strong>improving habits:</strong> perhaps I want to exercise more, drink less, or read<br>
a book each month.</li>
<li><strong>satisfying curiosity:</strong> perhaps I'm fascinated by data visualization,<br>
psychology, or lifehacking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether data collection is your focus or merely an unintended side effect,<br>
<em>this data makes it possible to know ourselves in new ways.</em> This<br>
self-knowledge is different from expert other-knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="self-knowledge-and-other-knowledge">Self-Knowledge and Other-Knowledge <a class="direct-link" href="#self-knowledge-and-other-knowledge">#</a></h2>
<p>Doctors are trained to recognize general patterns of the human body.<br>
From a diagnosis perspective, your medical history is only interesting<br>
insofar as it allows you to be grouped together with similar patients.<br>
That grouping is a <em>pattern profile</em> in your doctor's mind, and it informs their<br>
<em>expert other-knowledge</em> of you.</p>
<p>By contrast, you have intimate <em>self-knowledge</em> of your body and its symptoms.<br>
When do they occur? After eating which foods? In which locations?<br>
How often? How severe? The doctor will often ask these more <em>technical<br>
questions</em> to fill in the data missing from their patterns. There are,<br>
however, important questions that are often either missed or left barely<br>
explored:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What do those symptoms cost you?</em> What do they prevent you from enjoying in<br>
life? If you could solve one of them, which would it be?</li>
<li>If they are preventable, <em>why do you continue the behavior that causes or<br>
aggravates them?</em> What is the best way to get you to stop?</li>
<li><em>How do these symptoms impact those around you?</em></li>
<li>Do you really need medicine to deal with these symptoms? Could they be solved<br>
with more sleep? More exercise? Healthier diet? <em>What is the least invasive<br>
and costly means of addressing your issue?</em></li>
<li>If you do need medicine, <em>how can you be convinced to take it?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
Many of these questions hinge on *motivations, emotions, and relationships.*
As questions of identity, they may be more likely to lead to lasting
treatment. {" Too often, though, we cede complete control of personal
questions to doctors, teachers, and other experts. "} In doing so, we give up
the power to decide which questions are important and which are not.
</p>
<p>This is not to say that experts are without value. In their current<br>
incarnation, they fulfill much of the promise of the <a href="/blog/2012/10/02/welcome-to-quantified-savagery/">Quantified Mass</a>.<br>
Their (hopefully) extensive training equips them with powerful insights<br>
rooted in centuries of scientific inquiry.<br>
Powerful as those insights are, however, <em>they are ill-suited to address<br>
more personal questions</em> in a way that is meaningful to you.</p>
<h2 id="personal-identity-and-place-ism">Personal Identity And Place-Ism <a class="direct-link" href="#personal-identity-and-place-ism">#</a></h2>
<p>I titled this post:</p>
<blockquote>
Healthy Isn't A Place You Go To
</blockquote>
<p>What do I mean by that? Consider these popular sentiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>To become fit, I go to the gym.</li>
<li>To get well, I go to the doctor.</li>
<li>To learn, I go to school.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd argue that a lifetime of handing over control of these personal questions<br>
<em>conditions us to associate states of being</em> (fitness, wellness, learnedness)<br>
<em>with places</em> (gym, doctor, school). Those states become mechanical attributes<br>
devoid of identity, knobs we go elsewhere to have others tweak for us. For<br>
lack of a better term, I'll call this place-ism.</p>
<p>This isn't just philosophical posturing. There is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=behavior+change+and+identity">growing inquiry</a><br>
into the hypothesis that <a href="http://wayoftheduck.com/belief-change">behavior and belief change are linked</a>.<br>
A number of theories, such as<br>
<a href="http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory">self-determination theory</a> and the<br>
<a href="http://www.uri.edu/research/cprc/TTM/detailedoverview.htm">Transtheoretical Model</a>,<br>
have sprung up in an attempt to rigorously define these processes of change.</p>
<p>If that's the<br>
case, training ourselves to externalize behavior change can't be good, as it<br>
necessarily <em>reduces our capacity for belief change.</em></p>
<h2 id="beyond-place-ism...">Beyond Place-Ism... <a class="direct-link" href="#beyond-place-ism...">#</a></h2>
<p>Self-tracking allows us to <em>tie mechanical questions</em> - where? when? what?<br>
how much? - <em>to personal questions</em> and vice-versa. Data help us<br>
answer personal questions. Personal questions help us decide what<br>
data are needed to answer them. This cycle <em>makes us active participants in<br>
our own lives.</em></p>
<p>What role do experts have in this cycle? The point is not to exclude them<br>
entirely, but rather to <em>change their role from identity gatekeepers<br>
identity consultants.</em> By treating them as consultants, you seek advice<br>
of your own free will and with the understanding that some of it may not<br>
be applicable to you. You decide what role the consultant plays in your<br>
health, your education, your overall identity.</p>
<blockquote>
What if learning were not a place, but a state of being?
</blockquote>
<p>
This reminds of
[Feynman's spinning plates](http://www.thinkjarcollective.com/2012/07/richard-feynman-spinning-plates-and-serious-play/),
yet another demonstration of the power of *pervasive learning.* That word
pervasive is crucial. {" In this state, there are no boundaries on when, where,
or from what learning arises. "} There is *no schedule for learning.* There is no
switching between learning on and off modes, only a *variation in intensity.*

<p>How are</p>

<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
Self-tracking makes self-expertise possible.
</blockquote>
<p>related? <em>Self-expertise is the improvement.</em> It breaks place-ism, casts<br>
self-knowledge and other-knowledge as complementary equals, and moves us<br>
towards active participation. <em>Self-tracking is pervasive gameplay</em>, and<br>
that's awesome.</p>
