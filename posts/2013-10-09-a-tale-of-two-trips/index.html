      <h1>A Tale of Two Trips</h1>

<p>This summer, <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~valkyrie/">Valkyrie</a> and I travelled<br>
through Eastern Asia.  We started with the Great Barrier Reef and rainforests near<br>
Cairns, then went onwards to Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Korea<br>
before spending three typhoon-stricken days holed up in Manila, Philippines.</p>
<p>As with our <a href="http://fearlesstost.github.io/biketotheearth/">bike trip</a>, we kept<br>
a <a href="http://ramblelust.savageinter.net/">daily journal</a> of our travels in blog<br>
form.  In this post, I visualize the two trips from our blog entries using some<br>
simple word count graphs.  These aren't the most sophisticated visualizations<br>
possible, but they provide a simple starting point to build upon in future<br>
blog posts.</p>

<p>First of all, it feels good to write another post!  The rapidly upcoming <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/San-Francisco-2013/">Quantified Self 2013 Global Conference</a><br>
seemed like a good excuse to break seven months of blog neglect, so here I am.</p>
<p>I'll refer to these trips as <em>Bike to the Earth</em> and <em>Ramblelust</em> respectively,<br>
following the names of each trip blog.  Let's start with a look at the broadest<br>
of broad textual measures, word count.</p>
<h2 id="word-count">Word Count <a class="direct-link" href="#word-count">#</a></h2>
<p>How many words did we write for each trip?  How many per post, on average?</p>
<pre><code>$ python global_word_count.py &lt; BikeToTheEarth/posts_normalized.json
141329 words in 197 posts (717 words/post)

$ python global_word_count.py &lt; Ramblelust/posts_normalized.json
61010 words in 86 posts (709 words/post)
</code></pre>
<p>Not much difference here.  What happens if we graph the word counts over time?<br>
Top is Bike to the Earth, bottom is Ramblelust.</p>
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5Sv5_JZEDdw/UlcoazZGSxI/AAAAAAAAAks/9TZH7nDzpnQ/w1000/biketotheearth_daily_words.jpg" />
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BW5K-iWb56c/UlcoZ4fktZI/AAAAAAAAAkw/3g2w4bbbMtI/w1000/ramblelust_daily_words.jpg" />
<p>One point jumps out on the Bike to the Earth graph: <a href="http://fearlesstost.github.io/biketotheearth/posts/2010/10/19/hellbania.html">this post</a>,<br>
a massive 3600-word whopper that details our arduous exit from the rain-stricken<br>
Albanian coastline and into Greece.  For comparison, our longest post from<br>
Ramblelust was <a href="http://ramblelust.savageinter.net/blog/2013/06/29/cam-ranh-ing-around/">this one</a><br>
about our CouchSurfing experiences in Cam Ranh, a short distance south from<br>
Nha Trang along the Vietnamese coast.</p>
<p>Still, it's hard to make much out of such noisy data.  Let's smooth that a bit<br>
by looking at weekly averages. Again, top is Bike to the Earth, bottom is Ramblelust.</p>
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9YT2XueNpAs/UlcodH_CpwI/AAAAAAAAAkk/0ZnCYmXSMJc/w1000/biketotheearth_daily_words_smoothed.jpg" />
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-C-Q604GWq84/UlcoesNibrI/AAAAAAAAAjk/8RHMmaBdOi0/w1000/ramblelust_daily_words_smoothed.jpg" />
<p>Now another pattern pops out of the Bike to the Earth data: sometime around<br>
the beginning of September, our writing output doubled.  At that time, we were<br>
just entering Italy, where we were sandwiched in between the southern Alps<br>
and the sea for about 900km before reaching Rome.</p>
<p>As I go through this process, I'm constantly jumping back and forth between<br>
the blog posts and these graphs.  As with all visualization, this context is an<br>
essential part of understanding the data.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps <a class="direct-link" href="#next-steps">#</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of places we could go from here:</p>
<ul>
<li>sentiment analysis;</li>
<li>location-based visualization (by combining with country data);</li>
<li>authorship analysis (my posts vs. Valkyrie's posts)...</li>
</ul>
<p>...the list goes on.  What would you like to see?  Comment via Facebook or<br>
Twitter to let me know, and I'll put it into the next blog post.</p>
